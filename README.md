CS-350 Project: Thermostat

Q. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

A. To ensure that my code is maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I followed various coding best practices, such as following naming conventions and keeping the code simple and portable. Working on the CRUD module and on the dashboard, I also focused on commenting my code explaining the functionalities being implemented and the logic behind them. I also used abstraction to make the code reusable and adaptable. Furthermore, since the project was not complex, I conducted manual tests often, running it every time I developed a new functionality.


Q. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

A. My approach to developing this project was primarily focused on meeting the client's requirements. As I read the client's requirements, I defined the steps that I would take to develop each functionality. For example, before creating a callback functions to display the graphs on the dashboard, I first made sure that the query and dataframes had the correct information. Since I was not familiar with various concepts presented in this course, such as the numerous stages of the aggregation pipelines in MongoDB, part of my approach was also focused on reading the documentation of the tools being used to find the best ways available to solve a problem.


Q. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

A. The field of computer science has innumerous applications and, with the constant advancements in technology, it directly impacts people's daily lives. Software projects, like the dashboard created for Grazioso Salvare, allow for improvements in the ways data is perceived and used. Even though using databases to store data is a crucial part of this project, computer scientists must create ways for users to easily visualize it. Moreover, applications should add meaning to the data being displayed. For example, applications can be developed to identify correlations and proportions or filtering results based on user input.
